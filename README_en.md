# cocos-native-ios-helper

Before starting, it is necessary to manually build the project in Cocos Creator once to initialize Cocos' own document settings; otherwise, completion is not possible ([Official Tutorial](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/manual/en/editor/publish/ios/build-example-ios.html)).

- Step 1: Grant permission by running `chmod +x run.command` in the terminal.

- Step 2: Execute run.command (double-click the file).

- Step 3: Select the “Project Folder” through Finder.

- Step 4: Select the version.<br>
Currently available versions ("3.8.2", "3.8.1", "3.8.0") can be extended as needed.

- Step 5: Is there already a native/engine/ios folder? (y/n), choose `y`.

- Step 6: Completion.

## Future
- Apple - Game Center
- Apple - In-App Purchase (IAP)
- Waiting for you to expand
